# **CodeControlAC**  
*A Minecraft anti-cheat that supports versions 1.8 to 1.21.4*

---

## 📌 Overview

**CodeControlAC** is a Minecraft anti-cheat I built to keep servers fair and handle cheaters in a way that really messes with them. It’s packed with checks, fully configurable, and works across multiple Minecraft versions.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Client Crash on Threshold Limit**  
  If someone hits the threshold, it’ll crash their client. Simple as that.

- **Damage Reduction for Combat Checks**  
  When players get flagged too many times on specific combat checks, their damage gets gradually reduced, making it harder for them to do any real damage.

- **Movement or Action Cancellation**  
  Detects and cancels certain cheats, like *Blink*. Basically, the cheater thinks they’re moving around, but everyone else sees them just standing still. It’s not supposed to flag them—just frustrates them. This isn’t just for Blink, but I’ll keep the rest a mystery.

- **Highly Configurable**  
  You can edit pretty much everything: the plugin’s name, commands, alerts, and more to fit your server.

- **Version Support**  
  Works on Minecraft versions 1.8 through 1.21.4.

## ✅ Detection Checks

**CodeControlAC** includes a full range of checks to catch nearly any cheat out there. Here are a few of the main ones:

### ⚙️ Movement (Like Grim, but better)
- Covers almost any movement cheat, and you can configure it to either lag back or stay silent with no lag at all.

### 🗡 Combat
- **Killaura**: Has multiple detection types (A through H).
- **Reach & Hitbox**: Reach detection at 3.1; hitbox detection at 0.2.
- **Aim**: Has detection types A through I.

### 🛡 Other
- **Auto Totem**: Detection types A and B.
- **Crystal Aura**: Detection types A through E.
- **Bad Packets**: Detection types A through Z.
- **Baritone**: Detection types A through C.

### 🪨 Bedrock Checks (new)

- **Bfly**: Detection types A through C.
- **Breach**: Detection type A.
- **Bhitbox**: Detection type A.
- **Baura**: Detection types A through F.
